          <span className='h1'>Hi, I'm <span className='h2'>Shreyas Gunjal</span></span> 
          <p className='para0'>I am currently employed as a Software Engineer 
          (Associate IT Consultant) at ITC Infotech. 
          Prior to this role, I completed my engineering degree from SPPU University, where I developed a strong foundation in Engineering and Technical Skills. 
          I am passionate about Web & Software Development , 
          and I am committed to continuous learning and growth in this dynamic field.

          <p className='para1'>My fascination with computers began in primary school when 
          I first encountered the command prompt. This early exposure ignited a journey of 
          exploration into HTML and CSS during my senior secondary education. 
          Eager to expand my horizons, I delved into programming, immersing myself in C and 
          absorbing knowledge from books, online platforms, and various teachings.
          </p>

        <p className='para2'>As I advanced to university, my passion for technology deepened. 
          I dedicated myself to mastering computer fundamentals, data structures, and algorithms, 
          laying a solid foundation for my future endeavors. Through hands-on projects and coursework, 
          I gained practical experience and developed skills to tackle real-world challenges. 
          Along the way, I discovered my affinity for web development and design, creating visually 
          appealing and functional websites. Recently completing a comprehensive Java programming course, 
          I've enriched my skill set. 
          With a commitment to continuous learning and a passion for technology's positive impact, 
          I'm excited to contribute to shaping the future of technology.
